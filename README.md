## Why MoongladeV2 for Your Organization

MoongladeV2 is a production-ready, enterprise-grade knowledge base platform designed for teams that value simplicity without sacrificing essential features. While commercial solutions like Notion charge $10+ per user monthly and lack self-hosting options, MoongladeV2 delivers a comprehensive document collaboration system that deploys in minutes and costs nothing to run on your own infrastructure.

Key enterprise features include:

**Flexible Data Infrastructure.** Seamlessly switch between SQLite for quick deployment, MySQL for scalability, SQL Server for enterprise environments, or in-memory databases for testing. No complex configuration required.

**Enterprise Authentication.** Native OpenID Connect integration allows seamless connection to your existing identity provider with automatic role synchronization. Built-in user management provides a complete authentication solution out of the box.

**Fine-Grained Access Control.** Role-Based Access Control system with comprehensive permissions for users, roles, and documents. Dynamic navigation automatically adapts to user permissions, ensuring users only see what they should.

**Global-Ready Platform.** AI-powered translation supporting 27 languages enables worldwide team collaboration without language barriers. Comprehensive localization coverage ensures consistent user experience across cultures.
